# HTML-CSS-Javascript-Web-Terminal-1.0-
Finally, Its done.
1.0 Is done. And ready for New Year. Happy new year! After those many days from October, 2022 is coming. 
Thank god that its done. I don't expect updating HTML Terminal anytime soon in 2022.

Its basicly a terminal. Its free to use anyways so you could add commands.
"Nozomi" Is my name so its named nozomi.

    This is the Basic code.
    It has 3278 lines of repeating commands.
    so you have a bunch of space to code.
    the command it comes with is a basic "Hello-(Name Here)"
    so it includes 1 command.
    You could add a BUNCH of extra commands.
    Help with commands is highly apreciated.
