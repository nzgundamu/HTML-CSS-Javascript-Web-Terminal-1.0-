# HTML-CSS-Javascript-Web-Terminal-1.0-
Finally, Its done.
1.0 Is done. And ready for New Year. Happy new year! After those many days from October, 2022 is coming. 
Thank god that its done. I don't expect updating HTML Terminal anytime soon in 2022.
So, I would say my Goodbyes to Github and developing for now...
See you guys in 2023! (A rough estimate)
But, Thank you. And have a Happy New Year!
